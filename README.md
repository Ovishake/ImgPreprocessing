# Image Preprocessing for Machine Learning or Deep learning activities
This is a basic image pre-processing tutorial, made with the free open-source app called as ImageMagick. As some Tensorflow graphs are static, it is important to pre-process the image using some software, that is preferably open-source. This is made based on my favourite distribution: Fedora.

One of the most useful utilities for learning Machine Learning or for training a dataset is to resize the images to fit a particular size. ImageMagick comes installed by default in Fedora.

The Image Recognition API shows how to make the Tensorflow code using the Tensorflow Layers API and Tensorflow DatasetGenerator API. And feeding it to Tensorflow.
